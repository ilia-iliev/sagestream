# SageStream

This is a personal learning project and my first attempt at vibe coding a simple android application called SageStream. The functionality is described in prd.md. A rough journey of how it went:

1. Initially, I used naive prompting straight to agents on a blank project with zero files
2. This resulted in app that had a lot of issues in inconsistincies
3. I wiped the agent-created files and started anew. This time, I used Android Studio to create the skeleton - Java Version, Android Version, Logo for the app
4. Then I used prompting to guide the agents into doing my application
5. App (mostly) compiled but there were still a lot of recurrring bugs
6. I created TODO.md and prd.md to anchor the agents and provide some traceability of what has been tried
7. With some manual QA, this seemed to produce satisfactory results
